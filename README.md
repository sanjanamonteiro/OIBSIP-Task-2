* How the Code Works

~Data Loading:
The code imports the dataset using pandas for efficient data manipulation.

~Data Cleaning:
It removes missing values, standardizes column names, and converts date columns to proper datetime format to ensure accurate analysis.

~Exploratory Data Analysis:
Summary statistics and dataset information are displayed to understand the data structure and spot anomalies.

~Visualization:
The code generates visual plots to show unemployment trends over time and differences between regions/states, with a special focus on the Covid-19 period.

~Insights:
By examining the plots and trends, the analysis reveals the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment and highlights which regions were most affected.

This project provides a clear, visual, and statistical overview of unemployment in India during an important period, using Python data science tools.
